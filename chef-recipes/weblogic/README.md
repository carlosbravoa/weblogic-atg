# Weblogic Cookbook

## Scope
This cookbook installs Oracle Weblogic Server.
Oracle Java is also installed as a required dependency.
It does not install or manage any services.

## Requirements
* Chef 12 or higher
* Network accessible artifact repository

## Platform
* Centos 6
* Red Hat Enterprise 6

## Usage

### Resources
```
weblogic '10.3.6' do
  ownername 'weblogic'
  groupname 'weblogic_admin' 
end
```
### Attributes
```
node['common_artifact_repo'] = 'https://artifact.server/software'
```

### Common Artifact Repository
This cookbook uses a common artifact repository pattern. 
Artifacts urls will be generated in the following manner:

node['common_artifact_repo'] + vendor + product + version + file_as_named_by_vendor

eg. the above resource & attribute will attempt to retrieve artifacts from the following
locations:
```
https://artifact.server/software/oracle/weblogic/10.3.6/wls1036_generic.jar
```

Artifact urls can be overridden by specifying installer_url on the
resource.
